                                        There will be daily and weekly tournaments that players may participate in as a team or as a solo, and have the chance to win tokens, avatars, or rare items as prizes.

                                        On top of being able to earn tokens by playing the game, the tokens themselves are also appreciating assets, as the holders will be rewarded BUSD (Binance dollars which can be exchanged for fiat or other crypto currencies) everyday for simply holding the token (minimum 24 hour hold time after token purchase). These rewards come from the fees for every token transaction, which we then re-distribute to investors, and send directly to their wallet holding the Arena tokens. The more Arena tokens you hold, the more BUSD rewards you receive.

                                        Players purchase in-game currency called Arena tokens which they can then be used to wager on games against other players through five of our current games (Soccer, Football, Basketball, Tennis, and Boxing). Since each game is held in an arena, others may enter and watch the game. They may also place wagers on othersâ€™ games.

                                        As an ArenaVerse avatar holder, you have the ability to allow others to rent your avatar to be used in game. This provides the holder the ability to receive passive income from their NFTs as well as allow other players to play in the ArenaVerse without having to purchase an avatar.

These achievements will not be revealed to the public, and will be revealed as players accomplish them. There will also be weekly quests made public to everyone, and the first person or team to accomplish them will be rewarded.

                                        With each avatar having different designs and in-game stats, the value of each avatar will be completely unpredictable and will be decided by the players. This provides players the chance to mint extremely rare and high-performance avatars, which can be re-sold at whatever prices the players see as reasonable. Our mint price will never change.
